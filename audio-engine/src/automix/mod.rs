//! Planned transitions between songs: where the blend starts in the
//! outgoing song, where the incoming one comes in, how long they overlap,
//! the shape of the gain curve, the filter sweeps over each song, and an
//! optional rate for the incoming song so the two tempos line up.
//!
//! The scout decodes the end of the playing song and the start of the next
//! one into envelopes ([`SectionAnalyzer`]), unless the app handed over the
//! song's [`TransitionProfile`] from its server; a live tap follows the
//! playing song as it is heard ([`LiveAnalyzer`]); [`plan`] turns them into a
//! [`TransitionPlan`] that the mixer runs.
